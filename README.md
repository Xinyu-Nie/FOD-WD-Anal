# A Wasserstein Space-Based Framework for Processing Fiber Orientation Geometry in Diffusion MRI
This is a novel Wasserstein Space-based framework for processing and analyzing the fiber orientation distribution (FOD) functions.
We propose a new metric for FOD functions for analyzing and processing.
Interpolation of FOD functions is achieved through the Barycenter of the newly proposed metric. 
Besides, we developed a Fast Approximation method for the Wasserstein Barycenter to compute the interpolation efficiently. 
<br />
The algorithm was developed in Matlab. Please check ***Demo.m*** for example usage.  All necessary data to run the is contained in ***DATA.mat***.
