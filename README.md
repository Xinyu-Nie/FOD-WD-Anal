# A Wasserstein Space-Based Framework for Modeling and Processing of Fiber Orientation Geometry in Diffusion MRI
This is a novel Wasserstein Space-based framework for processing and analyzing the FOD functions. 
Interpolation of FOD functions is achieved through the Barycenter of the newly proposed metric. 
Besides, we developed a Fast Approximation method for the Wasserstein Barycenter to compute the interpolation efficiently. 
<br />
The algorithm was developed in Matlab. Please check ***Demo.m*** for example usage.  All necessary data to run the is contained in ***DATA.mat***.
