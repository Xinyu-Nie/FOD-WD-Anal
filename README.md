# A Wasserstein Space-Based Framework for Processing Fiber Orientation Geometry in Diffusion MRI
This is a novel Wasserstein Space-based framework for processing and analyzing the fiber orientation distribution (FOD) functions. <br />

We propose a new metric for analyzing and processing FOD functions. The Barycentr of the newly proposed metric achieves a new interpolation of FOD functions. Besides, we developed a Fast Approximation method for the Wasserstein Barycenter to compute the interpolation efficiently. <br />

The algorithm was developed in Matlab. Please check ***Demo.m*** for example usage.  All necessary data to run the is contained in ***DATA.mat***.
